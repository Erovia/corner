### kbfirmware.com -> mainline QMK converter

https://noroadsleft.github.io/kbf_qmk_converter

Behind the scenes, kbfirmware.com uses an ancient fork of QMK (3+ years old, afaik).  
Tries to bring the code generated by kbfirmware.com up to standards.  
It's a great starting point, to add support for boards that has kbfirmware json but, not supported by mainline QMK.

### VID/PID usage info

https://yanfali.github.io/qmk_usb_usage

Vendor and product IDs become become a topic of conversation with VIA, since it uses these two values to indentify a board.  
Pulls the usage data from the QMK API and allow filtering.  
Useful for those thinking about adding VIA support for their boards.
